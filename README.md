## LoRa Signal Detection and Decoding Simulation

This repository contains MATLAB files for simulating LoRa (Long Range) signals. LoRa is a wireless communication technology widely used in IoT (Internet of Things) applications due to its long-range capabilities and low power consumption.

## Files Included:

1. LoRA_Rx.m: This MATLAB script simulates the receiver (Rx) side of the LoRa communication system. It processes the received LoRa signal and extracts useful information from it.

2. LoRA_Tx.m: This MATLAB script simulates the transmitter (Tx) side of the LoRa communication system. It generates a LoRa signal with specified parameters such as spreading factor, bandwidth, and payload.

3. Pilot Files: Pilot files are provided to aid in the simulation process. These files may include predefined channel characteristics or other necessary parameters for simulating the LoRa signals.

## Usage:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the cloned/downloaded files.

3. Modify the parameters in the `LoRA_Tx.m` script according to your simulation requirements, such as spreading factor, bandwidth, payload, etc.

4. Run the `LoRA_Tx.m` script to generate the simulated LoRa signal.

5. Run the `LoRA_Rx.m` script to process the received LoRa signal and extract useful information.

6. Analyze the results obtained from the simulation to gain insights into the performance of the LoRa communication system under different conditions.

## Notes:

- Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system to run the provided scripts.
- Refer to the comments within the MATLAB scripts for detailed explanations of the code and parameters.
- Feel free to modify and extend the provided scripts to suit your specific simulation requirements.
